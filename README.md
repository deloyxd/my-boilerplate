This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) boilerplate project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, create or go inside the folder you want it to be cloned.

```bash
cd you-new-project
```

Then, clone this repo without its Git history:

```bash
npx degit deloyxd/my-boilerplate .
```

Finally, install node modules:

```bash
npm install
```

Test run it:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can then start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

You can modify the `metadata` in `src/config/metadata.ts` to change the title and description of the site. you can also modify the github link of your project in `other` section.

## Optimized Fonts

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
